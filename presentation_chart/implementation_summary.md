# Fertility Rate Chart Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

We've updated the Fertility Rate Chart application to fetch data from a new API endpoint and handle the data according to the `predicted` flag. Here's a summary of the changes:

### 1. Updated Data Source
- Changed the API endpoint from `http://localhost:5000/getData` to `http://52.17.53.243:5000/predictData`
- Switched from GET to POST request method
- Added historical data in the request body

### 2. Updated Data Processing
- Changed the filtering logic from year-based (`item.year <= 2023`) to flag-based (`!item.predicted`)
- Maintained the same visual style (blue for historical, red dashed for predictions)

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- Updated legend text to be more generic (removed specific year ranges)
- Added enhanced tooltips that indicate when data is predicted
- Updated error messages to reference the new endpoint
- Added fallback mechanism to use local data if the API is unreachable
- Enhanced error handling to detect and explain CORS issues

### 4. Documentation
- Updated README.md to reflect the new data source and implementation details
- Created a test.html file to verify API connectivity

## Files Modified

1. **script.js**
   - Updated data fetching logic
   - Changed data filtering to use the `predicted` flag
   - Enhanced tooltips
   - Updated dataset labels
   - Added fallback mechanism with local prediction data
   - Implemented warning message for when fallback data is used
   - Added specific CORS error detection and user-friendly explanation

2. **index.html**
   - Updated legend text to remove specific year ranges

3. **styles.css**
   - Added styling for the warning message

4. **README.md**
   - Updated documentation to reflect the new data source and implementation

4. **New Files**
   - Created test.html for API testing
   - Created this implementation summary

## Testing Instructions

### Testing the API Connection

1. Open `test.html` in a web browser
2. Click the "Test API Connection" button to verify connectivity with the API
3. If successful, you'll see sample data from the API response
4. Click "View Sample Data" to see the expected data structure

### Testing the Chart

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Verify that the chart loads correctly
3. Check that:
   - Historical data appears as a solid blue line
   - Predicted data appears as a dashed red line
   - Hovering over data points shows appropriate tooltips with prediction indicators

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **API Connection Errors**
   - The application will automatically use local fallback data if the API is unreachable
   - A warning message will be displayed when using fallback data
   - Check browser console for detailed error messages
   - Use test.html to isolate API connectivity issues
   - If you need to connect to the actual API, ensure there are no CORS issues or network restrictions

2. **CORS Issues**
   - When opening the HTML file directly from the file system, browsers will block API requests due to CORS security restrictions
   - The application will automatically detect CORS errors and display a specific message explaining the issue
   - We have updated the backend API server to support CORS:
     * Added Flask-CORS extension to the Flask application
     * Configured the server to accept requests from any origin
     * This allows the frontend to communicate with the API even when opened directly from the file system
   - Alternative solutions if CORS is still an issue:
     * Serve the files from a local web server instead of opening them directly
     * Use a browser extension to disable CORS for testing purposes

2. **Chart Display Issues**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify that Chart.js is loading correctly
   - Ensure the data structure matches what the chart expects

3. **Data Visualization Issues**
   - Verify that the `predicted` flag is being used correctly to filter data
   - Check that the chart datasets are configured correctly
